# R-test

This is a line from R

This is my second line from R

This should go into the new branch file called "Test"

Perhaps this will add another commit?

What happens if I don't commit? Why didn't this commit?


Let's test this and see if I can push it to the new R branch.  I'll commit before saving then push.. Ok I have to save first for the file to show up in the top right.


Ok so make a change, commit, then push?

YES!
